The Python script you previously generated failed during execution.

## Your Previous Code
```python
{code}
```
Error Encountered
{status}

Output File
{output}

Please revise the code to ensure:

- It reads from scraped_data.json
- It correctly answers the questions provided
- It writes the results to final_output.json
- It avoids any runtime errors
- It handles all data types appropriately from the JSON
- Values are converted to expected types (float, int, str, etc.) before processing
- It gracefully handles missing fields or inconsistent types using try-except or .get()
- If any unexpected error occurs during execution, do NOT suppress it silently
- Raise exceptions so the script exits with an error code
- Ensure final_output.json is created only if the answers are successfully computed

Important:  
Only return valid updated Python code.  
Do NOT include explanations, print statements, or markdown.
