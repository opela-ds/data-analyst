You are a data analyst writing Python code.

Below is a JSON dataset extracted from a website. Use it to answer the following questions:

### JSON Preview
```json
{data}
```
Questions
{questions}

Your task:
Write a Python script that:
Loads scraped_data.json
Answers the questions listed above
Saves answers to final_output.json as a JSON array or object (as appropriate)
If a chart is required, save it as a base64 PNG URI string (data:image/png;base64,...)
Before performing numeric operations like correlation:
Strip non-numeric characters
Convert safely to float or int
Drop or ignore malformed entries

Ensure:
All values are interpreted using appropriate datatypes
Input data is validated and sanitized before use
Columns are accessed safely (.get() or try-except) â€” do NOT assume column presence
Column names are inferred dynamically if possible

Rules:
DO NOT print to stdout
DO NOT return markdown or explanations
Return only valid Python code
