**Diagnosis:**
- The scraped data does not meet quality criteria: at least 3 relevant columns and 5 meaningful rows.
- Possible reasons:
  1. Wrong table selected (missing important columns like Title or Year).
  2. Column names don't match exactly, and fuzzy matching wasn't implemented.
  3. Table had merged/misaligned headers not properly split.
  4. All/most data in numeric columns are actually years, indicating column misalignment.
  5. Ensure that the code does not have any backticks "python".
  
**Required in the next attempt:**
- Implement fuzzy column detection (e.g., find any column containing 'gross' or 'rank' or 'title', regardless of exact spelling).
- If no single table matches all desired columns, choose the table with most relevant matches and rows.
- Print debug info: number of tables found and their columns before choosing.
- Avoid strict filters like requiring every column â€” this caused valid tables to be skipped.
- Clean headers and data to avoid year values appearing in gross columns.
- Save only when table passes checks: >=3 relevant columns, >=5 meaningful data rows.

You must produce a single, self-contained Python script that passes these checks.
