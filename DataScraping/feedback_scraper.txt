Please revise the code so it correctly scrapes, cleans, and saves the data to `scraped_data.csv`.

Make sure:
- All attributes have consistent and correct datatypes (e.g., float, int, string, datetime).
- No invalid strings or malformed entries are present in any column.
- Columns used for downstream analysis or logic are properly parsed and cleaned.
- Save structured data only â€” drop unrelated sections like footnotes or metadata.
